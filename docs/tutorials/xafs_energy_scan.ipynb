    "Running a scan in bluesky is a **two step process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **create a plan**. A plan generates messages with instructions to do things like move a motor, wait for a motor to arrive at its destination, and trigger and read a detector. To create a plan, you call a function that will generate these messages. **Calling the function doesn't actually execute the scan.** In our case, ``haven.xafs_scan(8325, 0.5, 1, 8350)`` will create the plan, but the plan will not do anything unless used with a run engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `haven.xafs_scan()` plan requires at least four values: *(start, step, exposure, stop)*. *start* and *stop* mark the boundaries of the energy range, in eV. *step* is the space between energy points, in eV. Unless the range between *start* and *stop* is a whole multiple of *step*, the *stop* energy will not appear in the scan. *exposure* is the time, in seconds, for which to count at each energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional argument *E0* specifies the energy, in eV, of an x-ray absorbance edge. If given, all other energy values (i.e. *start* and *stop*) will be relative to *E0*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, **execute the plan on the run engine**. At the top of this document we created a run engine. Now we will use this run engine to execute the plan. The run engine will read the messages and perform the appropriate tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the run engine finishes the plan, it will return a unique identifier (UID). This UID is the best way to retrieve the data from the database. We will save the UID to a variable, and also print it to the page in case we want to recall it later."
